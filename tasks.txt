TODO

- Setup grafana dashboard for todolist app.
python testing
- Write unit tests and integrations tests using python testing framwork
- Configure jenkins to run these tests before building an image
2. Kubernetes
- Scale up the app to use multiple pods
- Add prometheus monitoring to monitor the following
- Add grafana to plot all the charts
  - requests and response codes for each API
-  CPU and memory usage
  - response time


DONE

- Create a requirements.txt
- Use requirements.txt to install packages in dockerfile
- Create a version path in API
- Jenkins
    - Pull repo
    - Build docker image
    - Deploy push docker image to dockerhub with version tag
    - New docker image is build, tag is the timestamp (24093291817)
    - New deployment is triggered in kubernetes, that uses this latest 
    
- Write end to end pipeline that does 
    - When code is changed and pushed, pipeline is triggered automatically

- Rebuild docker image, push it to dockerhub
- Redeploy kubernetes pod and check if new code is running, test all APIs
- Write end to end pipeline that does 
    - When code is changed and pushed, pipeline is triggered automatically
    - The /version API shows the latest version tag in the API

- Create Helm repo for todolist app.
- Complete the bash project.
    -Write a bash script that does the following
    -Downloads the text from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amephraim/nlp/refs/heads/master/texts/J.%20K.%20Rowling%20-%20Harry%20Potter%201%20-%20Sorcerer's%20Stone.txt and stores it in a text file
    -Separates the words by splitting them by space
    -Count the occurance of each word and sort them by the frequecy
    -Take top 10 most frequent words and print them along with their frequencies
    -For the top 10 words, search and replace all of their occurances by all caps version of that word in a new copy of the text file


Bonus

-Create a single command that automatically portforwards whichever flash pod is running, no need to edit the command. Hint: "watch" and "grep" commands
    watch -n 1 "kubectl get pods | grep flask-app | grep Running && kubectl port-forward \$(kubectl get pods --no-headers -o custom-columns=:metadata.name | grep flask-app) 8888:8888"
- Combine all yamls into a single yaml and delete/deploy using single command



Test:
-Check if old task are present in /list api
